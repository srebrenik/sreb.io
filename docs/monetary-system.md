## Smart money of the Republic of Rus’

The monetary system of the Republic of Rus’ will consist of two types of money, having the dimension of physical quantities.

1. Zlatnik - commensurate with power, i.e. characterizes the instantaneous rate of energy transfer from one physical system to another in the process of its use.
2. Srebrenik - has the dimension of energy and is a measure of work, i.e. measure of energy change in a process. In addition, Zlatnik is a form of so-called [Free Money (Freigeld)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freigeld).

> Currently, the [demurrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_(currency)) rate is zero. That is, you can accumulate any amount of Srebrenik on your account. In the future, you will be able to freely convert Srebrenik into Zlatnik.

### How will it work

Zlatnik, in its essence, is a representation of a share in the power generated on the territory of the Republic of Rus’. In other words, it is a quota for power consumption. It is important to note that the quota does not imply that you will receive energy for free. The quota implies only access to a certain capacity.

One of the most important properties of Zlatnik is the ability to generate Srebrenik.

This means that a certain amount of Zlatnik, blocked on the so-called free deposit, will generate Srebrenik. The Srebrenik generation rate is described by the equation; d**Srbn**/dt = aexp<sup>-(Zltn-b)^2/2c^2</sup>**+r**  The generation rate is always positive and depends on the amount of Zltn on the free account.

Zltn - the amount of Zlatnik on the "free deposit"

a,b,c,r – correction factors

However, this does not mean that Srebrenik will accumulate in the account of the deposit holder indefinitely. Srebrenik is a form of so-called Free Money (Freigeld). This means that Srebrenik will be subject to a special tax - demurrage, which stimulates the high speed of their circulation.
Demurrage is the cost associated with holding or holding a currency for a specific period. It is sometimes referred to as the book value of money.
Currently, the demurrage rate is zero. Demurrage will be introduced no earlier than 1 year from the date of release into free circulation of Zlatnik.


It is important to note that the more Zlatnik in total on all deposits, the more Srebrennek can be accumulated on the corresponding account - d**Srbn**/dt =kexp<sup>(**Srbn**/h**Zltn**<sub>0</sub>)</sup>+w

– d**Srbn**/dt – rate of sinking of Srebrenik, demurrage

**Zltn**<sub>0</sub> - the total amount of Zlatnik on all deposits of one account

**Srbn** - the amount on Srebrenik's deposit

k,h,w - correction factors

In other words, if you accumulate Srebrenik and do not spend it, then at some point the equilibrium point will be reached. In this point, your deposit in Zlatniki will generate exactly as much Srebrenik as the amount of the demurrage payment. The same will happen with an excess of Srebrenik's savings in the account. The entire surplus will gradually be spent on the payment of demurrage and equilibrium will be established at the same point. Keeping an excess of Srebrenik on the account in such a situation is extremely unprofitable. In the event that there is a significant excess of Srebrenik, then it would be more profitable, for example, to give an interest-free loan or even a loan with a negative interest, which will be lower than the amount of demurrage. Such a system would encourage the use of Srebrenik as the main unit of account.

### What is the point in creating such a system

the economic system of the Republic of Rus’, will be built on the basis of a dual monetary system, pursues several important goals at once? 

1. Stimulates the reduction of energy costs and the development of energy-saving technologies 
2. Provides an unconditional basic income to any citizen 
3. Stimulates the turnover of funds in the economy 
4. Stimulates the investment activity of citizens of the Republic of Rus’
5. The proposed economic model will stimulate the development of the sharing economy.

To understand how this will be implemented, it is necessary to consider, without going into details, several important mechanisms that form the basis of the economic model of the Republic of Rus’

#### 1

As mentioned above, Zlatnik is physically commensurate with power and in fact is a quota for receiving a share of the power generated in the territory of the Republic of Rus’ or imported from outside. However, this does not mean that this quota gives the right to receive this capacity free of charge. This quota allows you to consume a certain amount of energy per unit of time and no more. In addition, when placing Zlatnik on a special, so-called "Free Deposit", the corresponding amount in Srebrenik will be paid. For the purposes of building an economic model, the dimension of Srebrenik corresponds to the dimensions of work and energy.

When buying any energy consumer (for example, a computer, an electric kettle, a car, etc.), a separate account is automatically created for this energy consumer and a certain amount in Zlatniks is blocked on it. The blocked amount on such an account ceases to generate Srebrenik. The value of this amount corresponds to the average power consumption of this device. This average power consumption is determined on the basis of theoretical calculations, experimental data and statistical data. The amount remains blocked on the deposit until the energy consumer is utilized or alienated in any other way. From under the action of this rule can be derived, for example, experimental energy consumers that are under development and testing or energy consumers that are museum exhibits.

Here it is important to pay attention to several important remarks. We are talking about any consumer of energy, whether it is a children's toy or a production workshop, regardless of whether it belongs to a private person or a company. 

Both Zlatnik on a free deposit and Srebrenik can be considered as a means of payment. You can always freely exchange Zlatnik for Silver and back at the exchange rate. 

However, the number of energy consumers you can afford will only depend on how much Zlatnik you have in your account.

The rule does not apply to items that are not direct energy consumers. For example, the house itself is not a direct consumer, but the heating system of this house will already be a consumer. Obviously, in such a situation, there will be reason to think about better thermal insulation of the house and the feasibility of using a heat pump heating system using low-grade heat sources or other energy-saving technologies. In addition, this approach will stimulate the sharing economy. There will be no point in acquiring, for example, a set of power tools, if you are not going to use them all the time, you can rent them. There is not much point in purchasing a washing machine if you do not have a large family and it is not used constantly, it is more profitable to use a laundry service, etc.

Zlatnik will also exist in the form of cash, which will be banknotes or coins with embedded microchips. That is, in fact, these will be hardware crypto wallets with a fixed amount. Cash Zlatnik will not be taken into account as an energy quota, will not be taken into account when calculating demurrage and will not affect the speed of Srebrenik generation

On the "free deposit" of each citizen, an inalienable amount in Zltn will be blocked, which will ensure the generation of Srbn, in an amount corresponding to the living wage. In other words, it will serve as a guarantee of obtaining an unconditional basic income.

Demurrage is a very effective tool to stimulate demand

#### 4

One of the main investment mechanisms is as follows. Suppose you have an excess of the quota for power consumption, that is, Zlatnik, but you have no desire to sell Zlatnik, since the total amount of Zlatnik on all your deposits affects the amount of demurrage and allows you to accumulate more Srebrenik. In this case, you can give a quota, that is, Zlatnik for rent to some enterprise that needs this quota. In this case, Zlatnik will be blocked on a special account and you will be able to receive payments in Srebreniki from the company for using the quota. In case of bankruptcy of the company, the entire blocked amount of Zlatnik will be returned to you. If you have an excess of Srebrenik on an account that you do not know how to spend, then it will be beneficial for you to give an interest-free loan or even a loan with a small negative interest, or you can exchange an excess of Srebrenik for Zlatnik to reduce the amount of demurrage, which, in turn, will allow , accumulate more Srebrenik not incur losses.

#### 5

The incentive mechanisms for the sharing economy are fairly obvious. We have already mentioned them above. There is no point in wasting the energy quota i.e. Zlatnik for the purchase of energy consumers that you do not use regularly, it is more profitable to rent them. Here we can consider another example. Imagine a village where people drill wells and acquire powerful pumps to pump water from underground. The pump must provide water from a certain depth and create the necessary pressure in the household plumbing system. In a situation where this means for you the consumption of an energy quota, it will be more profitable for you to invest in the construction of a water tower for a group of houses or the whole village and purchase one pump or a pair for all.
