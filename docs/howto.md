### How to obtain Srebrenik
1. **Support Ukraine and receive SRBN from us as a thank you for your help**

   By donating any arbitrary amount in Polkadot or Kusama to one of the Ukrainian charitable organizations included in the list, you will receive the equivalent amount in SRBN in your account. Send Polkadot tokens to a charity of your choice from a Polkadot wallet for which you have keys (do not send Polkadot tokens from an exchange address for which you do not have mnemonic keys). When the Srebrenik Collector Bot detects your donation, it will send the equivalent amount in SRBN to the Srebrenik account with the same mnemonic code as the donation sender's account. Coins will be issued at a certain rate proportional to the number of donated tokens.

   The Srebrenik faucet bot keeps track of a list of specific Polkadot addresses that are owned by organizations that accept donations at those addresses.

   When a donation is made to one of the listed addresses, the Srebrenik faucet will automatically send Srebrenik tokens to the substrate address of the sender of the donation.

   If you wish to obtain Srebrenik in this way, simply send Polkadot tokens to your chosen charitable organisation from a Polkadot wallet that you hold keys for (do not send Polkadot tokens from an exchange address you do not hold mnemonic keys for). When the Srebrenik faucet bot detects your donation, it will release Srebrenik tokens to a Srebrenik account with the same mnemonic as the donation sender account. Tokens will be released at a specific rate proportionate to the quantity of tokens donated.
