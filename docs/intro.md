## Objective of the project

Our goal is the establishment of the Republic of Rus, a state of a new type* with the highest possible
decentralization of authorities and a management system which iimplies the maximum involvement of
citizens in the decision-making process.

### Origins

We see our historical origins in the Novgorod Republic. We prefer the spirit of freedom of the primordial
Kievan Rus and the traditions of democracy of the Novgorod Republic over the traditions of authoritarian
power and the craving for imperial expansion of Moskovia and the Golden Horde
We build on the past but look to the future. Our priorities are; science, education, careful and rational
use of natural resources.

> At this stage, we declare that the project of the Republic of Rus has no territorial connection and does not imply a violation of
the territorial integrity and constitutional order of any state. Everyone has the right to build their own assumptions about the
territorial boundaries of the Republic.

### Scientific approach

The processes taking place now in the world are connected, first of all, with the changes that have taken
place in society quite recently. Despite the fact that not everyone is clearly aware of these changes,
which have led to a very deep conflict in society, and its aftermath, which could be really dramatic.

Without going into details, we can already claim that society has begun to work as a neural network. In
other words. Each individual makes a decision in the same way as a neuron is activated in a neural
network, that is, based on the configuration of activations of neurons in the adjacent layer.

The conflict arises out of the fact that most of us are not aware of what is going on. People continue to
build hierarchical systems which no longer function as intended. This happens because we continue to
falsely perceive 'neurons' in this network that have a large number of connections with large weight
contributions and have a significant impact on the activation of neurons in the adjacent layer as having a
higher position in the imaginary hierarchy than those that have connections with small weights.
However, this hierarchical construction turns out to be false. It can describe some special cases, but
contributes absolutely nothing to our understanding of the operation of the system as a whole.

People who are at the top of these artificial hierarchies do not always realize, but very keenly feel that
the hierarchical system no longer corresponds to the real configuration of society. They feel a loss of
control and begin to take chaotic and far from adequate actions aimed at preserving the system. They
are trying to force society back into the old system which is evidently not feasible.

This situation is twofold. We can either make a qualitative civilizational leap or be thrown back into the
dark ages. In order to minimize the dramatic aftermath of the current, rapidly developing conflict, we
must now start modeling a new type of state, using scientific methods and approaches to setting and
solving problems.

We encourage you to start organizing working groups and join the process of modeling a new type of
state. It is very important to understand that at this stage it would be a huge mistake on our part to
propose some kind of fixed, hierarchical organizational structure. This would be contrary to the very
essence of the Republic of Rus project. Now it is important to launch the process of self-organization of
people in the form of working groups with the widest possible variety of organizational forms.

What might this process of self-organization look like at the initial stage?

The principles of organization and work of the scientific community can be used as an initial basis. The
result of the work of working groups or individuals might be scientific articles, reports at conferences,
publicist materials, etc. Even a short comment on social media can sometimes have a significant impact
on the development of the concept.

### Road map

In view of the fact that we are forced to act in a situation with a high degree of uncertainty. Any planning
is now very conditional. It is rather like setting vectors of directions in which we will move in the near
future. The higher the degree of uncertainty, the more important is the creative situational initiative.

1. Creation of a decentralized payment system and Srebrenik SRBN crypto coin. (more)
2. Definition of "boundary conditions of the problem" in the form of a manifesto of the Republic of
Rus'. In other words, we should determine what we have and where we are moving.
3. Design and creation of the social network Republic of Rus'
4. Creation of decentralized voting systems based on blockchain technology.
5. Organization of the draft constitution of the Republic of Rus
6. Organization of a face-to-face conference (or a series of conferences) of the Republic of Rus to
discuss and approve the draft constitution of the Republic of Rus and determine further
development vectors.

### Premises and resources

It won't be "like before" - it's time to realize! We are all on the scene, under a thousand spotlights and
we no longer have any option to escape. The complacent expectation of better times and infantile,
irresponsible inaction with the hope that “everything will be as before” and “everything will be decided
for you” will lead to the fact that the world will collapse in front of our eyes, and no one will offer us a
new one. There is no exaggeration in this. The drama is already unfolding right in front of you and you
are a direct participant in it. There are no more places for spectators in the world. For the time being,
you look at some things through the TV screen or computer, but this screen will no longer protect you.
Everything that you see there can very quickly burst into your life like the four horsemen of the
apocalypse; plague, war, famine and death.

However, the good news is that we have everything we need to start designing the building of a new
society. There are people, hundreds of thousands of scientific studies, powerful information exchange
systems, and so on. All that is needed is the will to act, and it will be the decisive factor for success. It is
time to collect, organize and use the available information. It's time to build new systems of interaction
and decision making.

We call on all people who are able to think and act to join the project of the Republic of Rus' or offer
their own alternative projects. The most viable will be determined as a result of fair and open
competition.
